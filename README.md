Project Title and Team Name: Study Buddy; Team 19

Application Description

Problem: Many students struggle with making connections with other students in their classes. Especially in larger lectures, it can be difficult to find an opportunity or avenue to meet and talk with those around you.

Solution: An application where students can connect with and form study groups with other students taking the same classes as them. A student can create a study group that others can join if they are also in the same course.

Key Features: This application will help address our problem because it will be a group of people who are looking for study partners so it takes off the added pressures of a student being afraid of cold real world introductions.

Why this project: Being in college can be an isolating and tumultuous experience for many students and the sheer number of other students they interact with on a daily can potentially be overwhelming. What this application entails to do is to help foster a sense of community between students while encouraging academic growth.
